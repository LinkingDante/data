## Linking Dante: data and ontologies.

Linking Dante (LiDa) is a project that exemplifies the usage of OWL 2 DL in the digitization of both Dante's *Commedia* and of a consistent body of knowledge about it, including **content**, **structure**, **morphology**, **syntax** and **intertextual relationships** (in progress). The digitization has produced a Linked Open Data (LOD) dataset, which we call *Dante's Knowledge Graph* consisting of several tightly integrated RDF graphs, each being an OWL 2 DL ontology addressing a specific aspect of the *Commedia*.  
The DKG has been generated by processing the dataset at the basis of the [DanteSearch](https://dantesearch.dantenetwork.it/download.jsp) portal.  
The graph is stored in a triple-store and accessible via [SPARQL queries](https://lida.dantenetwork.it/sparql). A [Web UI](https://lida.dantenetwork.it) for browsing the poem and execute specific queries is also available.  

This repository contains the [ontologies](src/ontologies) defined and the RDF [files](src/dataset).
